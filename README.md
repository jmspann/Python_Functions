<h1>Working with Python Functions</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Built-in functions are functions that exist within Python and can be called directly. They help analysts efficiently complete tasks. Python also supports user-defined functions. These are functions that analysts write for their specific needs. <br/>
<br />
For example, patterns in login attempts could reveal suspicious activity. Python functions can help analysts work efficiently with lists of login attempts. Both built-in functions and user-defined functions in Python can help security analysts analyze login attempts. <br/>
<br />
In this lab, you'll use built-in functions to work with a list of failed login attempts per month to prepare it for further analysis, and you'll define a function that compares the user's login attempts for the current day to their average number of login attempts. <br/>
<br />

<h2>Scenario</h2>
In your work as a security analyst, you're responsible for working with a list that contains the number of failed attempts that occurred each month. You'll identify any patterns that might indicate malicious activity. You're also responsible for defining a function that compares the logins for the current day to an average and improving it by adding a return statement.
